main.py contains the solution for Day 19 of the 100 Days of Code: Python course from Dr. Angela Yu. This version of the program prompts a user for a color that must be a part of the colors list that is defined in the program. The program creates x amount of turtles based on the number of colors in the colors list and lines them up along the y-axis. The turtles then race against one another until a turtle reaches the position x = 231 where the race is ended an a winner announced.
